<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The BlueDolphin Platform Enhancer Extension came about from the need to adjust the current dWeb Platform IDE and where possible provide simple yet streamlined options to make using the platform easier


Here's why:
* I wanted more functionality and better overall setup; so instead of waiting I just did.



### Built With
The main frameworks of this extension and IDE used to build this extension.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)



## Getting Started

To get started simply visit one of the following Browser App Stores:
* [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bluedolphin-platform-enha/hdogaacdiofknhklffbmjcamndidnppa) 


and install the addon; once done it will auto-enable when on the Boomi Web Platform.


### Installation

1. Visit one of the following Browser App Stores:
   * [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bluedolphin-platform-enha/hdogaacdiofknhklffbmjcamndidnppa).

2. Click Install


## Usage

The following provides the current abilities of the released extension for use within the Boomi Web Platform:

* Button to Copy View Current URL Button (both in main navbar and in the Context Menu - the three dots)
* Button Reload Web Interface Button
* Reminder - When creating a new BPM that it needs to be created in Objects first
* Button or pressing Shift+? to bring up current BlueDolphin Key ShortCuts
* BPM 2.0 Implemented via Extension as alternative to Out of the box BPM tooling until BlueDolphin update
* Add Your Own Custom Architecture View Templates to the Create Screen; You Simply Define your Templates into the defined JSON Array and provide it to the Extension via the Options Screen. (As many as you want)
  * ```json
    [{
        "templateName": "What do you want to call it",
        "bdId": "ID That is Assigned to the View in the Web URL",
        "base64Image":"And Encoded Base64 String to display the image of the View"
    }]
